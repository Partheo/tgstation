  - bugfix: "All whiteships now emit GPS signals from their nav consoles. As a result, the Pubby whiteship now has a GPS signal."
  - balance: "Space exploration got a number of tweaks. Expect to see some old loot vanish and some new loot to appear in its place. New random loot spawns have been added in various ruins. More ruins have GPS signals. Space-ruin and whiteship GPS signals are no longer uniquely named."
